Open Pycharm on the src folder inside this directory and run main.py with the correct arguments
You can also run the program through the command line:
```
python main.py <algorithm>
python main.py <algorithm> <file>

Examples:
python main.py simulated_annealing
python main.py hill_climbing b_should_be_easy
```

Note that this project was developped in Python3 so make sure you run using that version\
You might need to run ```python3 main.py <algortihm> <file>```
